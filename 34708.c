 * 'server identifier' MUST NOT be filled in, 'requested IP address'
 * option MUST NOT be filled in, 'ciaddr' MUST be filled in with
 * client's IP address. In this situation, the client is completely
 * configured, and is trying to extend its lease. This message will
 * be unicast, so no relay agents will be involved in its
 * transmission.  Because 'giaddr' is therefore not filled in, the
 * DHCP server will trust the value in 'ciaddr', and use it when
 * replying to the client.

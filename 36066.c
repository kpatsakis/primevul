		 * unmapped, migration may fail and this page has to be
		 * charged again. We set MIGRATION flag here and delay uncharge
		 * until end_migration() is called
		 *
		 * Corner Case Thinking
		 * A)
		 * When the old page was mapped as Anon and it's unmap-and-freed
		 * while migration was ongoing.
		 * If unmap finds the old page, uncharge() of it will be delayed
		 * until end_migration(). If unmap finds a new page, it's
		 * uncharged when it make mapcount to be 1->0. If unmap code
		 * finds swap_migration_entry, the new page will not be mapped
		 * and end_migration() will find it(mapcount==0).
		 *
		 * B)
		 * When the old page was mapped but migraion fails, the kernel
		 * remaps it. A charge for it is kept by MIGRATION flag even
		 * if mapcount goes down to 0. We can do remap successfully
		 * without charging it again.
		 *
		 * C)
		 * The "old" page is under lock_page() until the end of
		 * migration, so, the old page itself will not be swapped-out.
		 * If the new page is swapped out before end_migraton, our
		 * hook to usual swap-out path will catch the event.

	 * We must loop because handle_mm_fault() may back out if there's
	 * any difficulty e.g. if pte accessed bit gets updated concurrently.
	 *
	 * VM_FAULT_WRITE is what we have been hoping for: it indicates that
	 * COW has been broken, even if the vma does not permit VM_WRITE;
	 * but note that a concurrent fault might break PageKsm for us.
	 *
	 * VM_FAULT_SIGBUS could occur if we race with truncation of the
	 * backing file, which also invalidates anonymous pages: that's
	 * okay, that truncation will have unmapped the PageKsm for us.
	 *
	 * VM_FAULT_OOM: at the time of writing (late July 2009), setting
	 * aside mem_cgroup limits, VM_FAULT_OOM would only be set if the
	 * current task has TIF_MEMDIE set, and will be OOM killed on return
	 * to user; and ksmd, having no mm, would never be chosen for that.
	 *
	 * But if the mm is in a limited mem_cgroup, then the fault may fail
	 * with VM_FAULT_OOM even if the current task is not TIF_MEMDIE; and
	 * even ksmd can fail in this way - though it's usually breaking ksm
	 * just to undo a merge it made a moment before, so unlikely to oom.
	 *
	 * That's a pity: we might therefore have more kernel pages allocated
	 * than we're counting as nodes in the stable tree; but ksm_do_scan
	 * will retry to break_cow on each pass, so should recover the page
	 * in due course.  The important thing is to not let VM_MERGEABLE
	 * be cleared while any such pages might remain in the area.
